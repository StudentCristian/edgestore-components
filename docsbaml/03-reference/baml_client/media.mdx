description: Learn how to handle image and audio inputs in BAML functions
---

BAML functions can accept both image and audio inputs for multimedia processing capabilities. Choose the appropriate type based on your needs:

<Cards>
  <Card
    title="Image"
    icon="image"
    href="./image"
  >
    Create Image objects from URLs, base64 data, or browser-specific sources like File and Blob objects.
  </Card>

  <Card
    title="Audio"
    icon="volume-high"
    href="./audio"
  >
   Create Audio objects from URLs, base64 data, or browser-specific sources like File and Blob objects.
  </Card>
</Cards>
